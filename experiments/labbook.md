### General notes / thoughts

- 3 * 64 * 64 works well with out of the box celeba settings for blondbrunette but not eyeglasses. Perhaps the kernels and / or padding need to be smaller because glasses take up fewer pixels?


### Todo

- Smiling / not smiling with out of the box settings
- Male / female with out of the box settings
- Try reduce the kernel size and / or padding of the network.
