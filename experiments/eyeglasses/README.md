11/10 Trained for 100k epochs on 9k eyeglasses and 9k no eyeglasses images (disjoint dataset with blondbrunette experiment from the same day)

Hard to learn. Eyeglasses perhaps too subtle and/or varied for this resolution.

Next step: Try out other pairs of distributions that can learn well with 10 - 15k images to be paired with blond to brunette
- Perhaps smiling / not smiling or male / female

Roughly 10k per hour (maybe less)
